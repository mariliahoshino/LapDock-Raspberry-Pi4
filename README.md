# LapDock-Raspberry-Pi4
How use a LapDock

Firstly, I bought an old LapDock Motorola
And need change the batteries

The olds batteries are swollen

I bought the new batteries and changed in pack

After I bought a Case Argon

I bought some cables, USB and HDMI

The LapDock don't send the configuration for display, it isn't possible use the automatic mode
It's necessary change the files
In the folder config ther're original files and modifieds files to:
NOOBS
Raspbian
RecalBox

After modified the files, now the LaPiTop is working very well
